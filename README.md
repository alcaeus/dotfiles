# alcaeus' dotfiles

## Usage

To setup all subsystems (dotfiles, brew/cask apps, App Store apps, macOS settings) run the setup script:
```
./setup
```

If you only want to install parts, use the specific install scripts:
```
./setup-brew.sh
./setup-apps.sh
./setup-dotfiles.sh
./setup-macos.sh
```

## Disclaimer

The entirety of these files is experimental - what works for me may not work for you. Use at your own risk.
